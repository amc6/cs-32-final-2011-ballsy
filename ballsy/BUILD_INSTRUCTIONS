Quick instructions on how to build with ant.
To build for mac use the command: ant mac
For windows running 32bit java: ant win32
For windows running 64bit java: ant win64

You can also try building for linux using ant linux64 or ant linux586
These last two for linux are completely untested and will probably not work.

Once you have run the command, a zip file will appear in the respective folder.
You can also run ballsy.jar from the build directory. build will contain the last
version that was built.
